# The Ashley Lab 🫀

### The Science of Precision Medicine 🩺 

We are a multidisciplinary research group in the [Stanford School of Medicine 🌲⚕️](https://med.stanford.edu/) led by [Dr. Euan Ashley](https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/our-team/principal-investigator/). Our work sits at the intersection of genomics, artificial intelligence, and clinical medicine, with the goal of translating discoveries into better diagnostics and therapeutics for patients.

Our two biggest areas of focus are **AI** and **the human genome**. We are deeply interested in extremes: of human performance, of comparative biology, and of disease. We are fascinated by the heart: how it develops, adapts, contracts, and fails. Our team spans mathematicians, molecular biologists, physicians, genetic counselors, and engineers, from undergraduates to junior faculty.

### Research Areas

🧬 **The Human Genome** · Whole genome sequencing, variant interpretation, and clinical genomics through the [Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease](https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/medicine/) and the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.

🤖 **Artificial Intelligence** · Large language models for genomic analysis, protein design for next generation gene therapy vectors, and AI driven clinical decision support across imaging and multi modal data.

🏃 **Human Performance** · Genomics of elite athletes ([The ELITE Study](https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/science/human-performance/)), the molecular map of exercise ([MoTrPAC](https://motrpac.org/)), and digital health through the My Heart Counts app.

🧫 **Cardiac Biology** · Single cell and iPSC derived cardiomyocyte models to study cardiomyopathy, from whole heart physiology down to individual cells.
